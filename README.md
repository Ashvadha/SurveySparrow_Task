Overview
This repository contains code for selecting and evaluating multiple machine learning models. The pipeline includes:

Model Selection: Compares and selects the best-performing model from Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost.
Model Saving: Saves the best model for future use.
Future Work: Plans to build a stacking model using all the selected models.
Approach
1. Preprocessing
Before running the model selection pipeline, ensure that your data is preprocessed. This includes:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Scaling numerical features
2. Model Selection
The select_and_save_best_model function performs the following tasks:

Model Definition: Defines Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost classifiers.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Uses Grid Search with Cross-Validation to find the best hyperparameters for each model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates models based on accuracy.
Model Saving: Saves the best-performing model to a file.

These modules will be in a piperline that it owrks common for all datasets and saves the model.

3. Building a Stacking Model (Future Work)
All the model build using different dataset will be used to build a stacking model. Stacking involves training multiple models and combining their predictions to improve overall performance. The stacking model will leverage the strengths of all models which works as a generic model for chrun prediction across all dataset.
